# Minimax for Tic-Tac-Toe

This minimax example was inspired by a [blog post](https://medium.com/ml-everything/tic-tac-toe-and-connect-4-using-mini-max-deb25544f3b7) from Branko Blagojevic and by this [repository](https://github.com/danigb/minimax) from danigb.

It extends the normal [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm by a time penalty and a possibility of sub-optimal plays from O. By doing so, we try to finish early and also to benefit as much as possible from Os potential mistakes.
